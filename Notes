TO DO

- Implement more mechanics
- Use a "camera" to display rooms larger than the screen
- Make doors between rooms
- Make a (sample version of a) "campaign" with a series of levels
- Implement box selection and dragging in editor

Note about room size: position coordinates are stored as single bytes
This means that, as they are, rooms can be no larger than 256 x 256
This is probably not a problem, but I've noted the places where this
size limit matters with "IF NOT BIGMAP"

Note about the SwitchLink structure: it might be cool to have (optional)
multiple switches and multiple gates, with an "all/at least one" boolean
This can be accomplished by building a "fake" switch that receives signals
from all of the real switches, and only signals the gates when
the condition is satisfied.
