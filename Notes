TO DO

- Implement more mechanics
- Use a "camera" to display rooms larger than the screen
- Make doors between rooms
- Make a (sample version of a) "campaign" with a series of levels
- Implement box selection and dragging in editor

Application order of Deltas:
- Move all objects that are trying to move
- Destroy/Create objects as necessary
- Handle switch/gate states
- Update group relationships

Note about room size: position coordinates are stored as single bytes
This means that, as they are, rooms can be no larger than 256 x 256
This is probably not a problem, but I've noted the places where this
size limit matters with "IF NOT BIGMAP"
