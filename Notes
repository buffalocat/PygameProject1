TO DO

Sokoban:
- Make a better level editor using tkinter
- Implement more mechanics
- Use a "camera" to display rooms larger than the screen
- Make the level encoding less janky
- Make a (sample version of a) "campaign" with a series of levels

Go:
- Complete the implementation of Go with passing, scoring, and a ko rule (maybe)
- Actually make it work online (not a Go problem)
- Determine what can be abstracted into the Game class
  (this may not become clear until we've implemented a few different games)

Online Multiplayer:
- Try again with IPv6 (currently trying to implement this)
- Make the online communication protocol neater and safer
- Unify local and online implementations of multiplayer games
  (as it is, the code for Go is duplicated)

Other:
- Make things prettier
