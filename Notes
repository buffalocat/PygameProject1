TO DO:
- Implement certain GUI elements from scratch
  (or figure out how to regain focus automatically from tkinter)
- Make the online communication protocol neater and safer
- Determine what can be abstracted into the Game class
  (this may not become clear until we've implemented a few different games)
- Unify local and online implementations of multiplayer games
  (the single player Go code is still there, but it's duplicated)
- Complete the implementation of Go with passing, scoring, and a ko rule (maybe)
- Make things prettier
